        <p><strong>Canarsie, Brooklyn</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Canarsie/Rockaway Pkwy (L)</li>
            <li>On the other end of the L Train</li>
            <li>The L Train of the New York City Subway remains in critical condition years since Hurricane Sandy caused damage to its facilities. Multiple plans to repair the line have been proposed over the years, including partial/full shutdown of the line. Most often, the debates of these plans and their impact on residents, businesses, and the communities focus more on the western, Manhattan part of the line (14th Street), as well as neighborhoods closer to the 14th Street tunnel, whereas transit demands of residents further down the line were sometimes ignored. Imbalance in different communities’ involvement the process, inevitably due to their economic power in the city, also means that the transit demand of this neighborhood could be contingent upon the actions of neighborhoods further down the line.</li>
            <li>This project would like to survey the neighborhood at the eastern end of the line (Canarsie/Rockaway). In particular, this project would like to document/reconstruct ways the community’s transit demands were/are left out in the decision-making process, as well as damages they have caused to the community. Potential media subjects for this project could include, for the ecology, signs/evidence of infrastructural accommodations made in response to the L Train Project (constructions, etc.), and for the event, the people who are involved in the process (their stories, the media objects they produced, etc.).</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Flushing, Queens</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Flushing Chinatown</li>
            <li>The Chinatown in Flushing, Queens is now the largest Chinese ethnic enclave in New York City. Whereas the neighborhood is flourishing as a popular tourist destination, it has many of the common problems of an ethnic enclave, such as differential treatment by law enforcement, non-integration in the city, and low involvement in city-wide politics (see, for example, <a href="https://www.nyccfb.info/media/reports/2018-2019-voter-analysis-report/">New York City Voter Analysis Report 2018-2019,</a> pp. 30-31, 54 &amp; 58).</li>
            <li><em>Focus 1</em> Sanitation, <strong>Main Street, Flushing</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>One of the unique sights in Chinatowns would be the many fresh meat and produce markets along the street. What is also present with the markets is the visible sewage and trash on the street front (this is visible in both the Manhattan Chinatown (Canal St.) and in Flushing). Not only does it constitute a sanitation issue, it is also reflective of the differential treatment by the city’s sanitation department, and sometimes plays into cultural stereotypes. This project should not only document the presence of such phenomena, but also investigate the interaction of various parties, from food vendors to the city to residents, regarding the issue.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><em>Focus 2</em> Sex workers in the ethnic enclave
                <ul>
                    <li>During my research in to the Queens Chinatown, I found news reporting since 2019 regarding prostitution in this Chinatown. In this case, sex workers, as a marginalized group, face a multitude of systemic problems, from the legality of their job and immigration status, and the possible denial of access to social services as a result, to the imminent threat of selective policing, which are stacked on top of existing issues in the enclave. This project hopes to discover and document the ways in which the conditions and needs of this group are ignored or acted up by other groups in the community. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>East River</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pollution</li>
            <li>Unlike its western counterpart, which has always been a major waterway, East River has been used instead as an outlet for the city’s sewage. This has caused extensive damage to the ecosystem along the river, as well as the quality of life of residents living alongside it (northern Brooklyn/Queens, along the shore). This project would like to explore the asymmetry in power of different groups along the pollution chain (e.g. who caused the pollution versus who are impacted by it) and their interactions.</li>
