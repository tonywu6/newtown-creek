            <h1>Sound Project Proposal</h1>
        </header>

        <p>Sound as a medium is simultaneously limited and powerful in affect. In comparison to, for example, images, it carries significantly less information. Yet at the same time, unlike images, which have the property of being “long-term” (for example, we can stare at it, or look at it later), sound is ephemeral. Its presentation runs strictly forward in time (rewinding disrupts the presentation, and is not desired for a media presentation). As a result, this sound project should utilize this aspect of sound, and consider: how can the representation of space (which is an important matter in this ecology study) in terms of time.</p>
