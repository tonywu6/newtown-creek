    <article>

        <p>This essay is a preliminary exploration into the various ideas and concepts related to this ecology project, both as individual concepts and as their relationships to one another. Such relationships should eventually build up to become the working theory of this project.</p>

        <p>Currently, this project theorizes four distinct concepts and their relationships: <strong>environment, affect, political economy,</strong> and <strong>medium.</strong> This essay considers the first two: they are the material basis of this research — the substance.</p>

        <h2>Environment </h2>

        <figure><img src="static/img/w4/w4-operatic-9.jpg" /></figure>

        <p>The term <em>environment</em> has always been highly-loaded in our everyday usage. Its original (etymological) meaning concerns “surrounding” and “encompassing” — “the area surrounding a place or thing.” </p>

        <p>Today, standalone usage of <em>environment</em> often connotes the “natural environment” or nature, which is in turn contrasted with the “built environment.” A dichotomy of these two ideas only became significant since the Industrial Revolution, when the latter came into increasingly sharp conflict with the former. On one end, this conflict, interpreted through an anthropocentric framework (which arose around the same time), led to the thinking of nature (the feminized: “mother nature”) as being subordinate, subjugated to mankind’s will. On the other end, the reckoning with and critique of this anthropocentrism lead to theories on environmental protection and the environmentalism movement.</p>

        <p>Environments are <em>substantial,</em> and are often thought of in terms of <em>resources</em> — “water resource,” “natural resource,” etc. As it is concerned with resources, the scarcity of which naturally becomes a topic. An often invoked concept is the “tragedy of the commons” — as (natural) environmental resources are simultaneously limited and unlimited in the eye of its users, human usage of the natural environment has become a form of “exploitation.”</p>

        <p><mark>Environment is, therefore, the tangible <em>subject</em> of this media project.</mark> This means that, in broad terms, this research project should look into the questions of <em>“what”</em> it is, or what is in it: the water, the flora and fauna, the factories, etc. It is a research into how the water of Newtown Creek had been perceived as a resource by various of its users (as a means of transportation? garbage cans? a park?), and the material impact of such perceptions. Studying the environment as a subject poses a unique challenge because it is encompassing: the observer is always <em>within</em> nature and entangled with it. The research must also pay attention to the many pitfalls in our usual thinking, such as the separation of human (built) and natural environments.</p>

        <h2>Affect</h2>

        <figure><img src="static/img/w5/illustration-theory-affect-1.jpg" /></figure>

        <p>In contrast with <em>environment,</em> <em>affect</em> as a concept is not nearly as much used in everyday settings at all — despite it being similarly as substantial as the environment. <em>Affect</em> and <em>environments</em> are closely related. <em>Affect</em> is the effect that the <em>environment</em> impinges upon us — it is the “atmosphere” that we may feel as we enter a new space. Viewed from another angle, it is the corporeal change that our body undergoes as it responds to a change in its <em>environment</em> (either it enters a new one, or the environment has changed). </p>

        <p>The concept of affect had been described in psychological terms, and is often infused with ideas such as “feelings” or “emotions.” However, such mingling of concepts had led to the downplaying of the substantiality of affect, as feelings and emotions connote with the “soul” or the “mind,” and therefore ephemeral and, through the lens of materialism, secondary. </p>

        <p>Contemporary scholars, such as Teresa Brennan, conceptualize affect as “energetic,” and the way the environment impacts us through affect as the “transmission” of this energy. Through her framework, <em>affect</em> is elevated to the first-class status, becoming a common aspect of both humans and the environment (and therefore, humans and the environment as equal participants). Meanwhile, Jane Bennett proposes the concept of “thing-power,” in which she focuses predominantly on the affect-producing capabilities of inorganic matters — in which inanimate objects gain vitality and behave as “lively” as human beings, interacting with each other in complex ways and therefore produces complex and <em>chaotic</em> behaviors (which may be catastrophic: Bennett illustrates this assemblage of things and its power using the 2003 North American blackout). In this framework, again, the previously subordinate order of things that is the physical and natural environment becomes primary. Effectively, Bennett refutes anthropocentrism by denying that only humans, and not things, have agency (or denying the myths of free agency, for that matter).</p>

        <p><em>Affect</em>, as it concerns how humans should be placed back into the vast and vibrant interactions in the physical world, becomes <mark>the <em>means</em>, or <em>method</em>, to observe the environment, through which this project should research its subject.</mark> This means both paying attention to the affective power of the environment — in what ways the “things” in Newtown Creek exert their influence upon us — as well as upholding the idea that the changes in the environmental system, on their own, merit as much discussion as the humans causing it.</p>
