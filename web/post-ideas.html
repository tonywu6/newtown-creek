        <p><strong>Transit Inaccessibility in Canarsie, Brooklyn</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The L Train of the New York City Subway remains in critical condition years since Hurricane Sandy caused damage to its facilities. Multiple plans to repair the line have been proposed over the years, including partial/full shutdown of the line. Most often, the debates of these plans and their impact on residents, businesses, and the communities focus more on the western, Manhattan part of the line (14th Street), as well as neighborhoods closer to the 14th Street tunnel, whereas transit demands of residents further down the line were sometimes ignored. Imbalance in different communities’ involvement in the process, inevitably due to their economic power in the city, also means that the transit demand of this neighborhood could be contingent upon the actions of neighborhoods further down the line.</li>
            <li>This project should capture, for example, images of the state of the subway infrastructure, including stations and accessibility features; alternative means of public transport such as buses in the neighborhood and signs of accommodation to the changing L train project, such as notices; meanwhile, it should get in touch with residents and explore their stories, opinions, and actions taken, and document them through e.g. recorded conversations/interviews. It may also create graphs using collected data to illustrate the impact of the L train project.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Water Pollution of Newtown Creek</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Water pollution of Newtown Creek, a tributary of the East River separating Brooklyn and Queens, dates back to the late 19th century when areas along its shoreline experienced heavy industrialization. For much of the 20th century, industrial sewage and oil spills (including the Greenpoint Oil Spill) have destroyed much of the river’s ecosystem. Despite increasing cleaning efforts in recent years, the ecosystem of the river remains fragile. Designated a Superfund site in 2010, the cleanup work of Newtown Creek also faces new threats from the Trump administration, as they are stifling EPA activities by e.g. freezing EPA grants.</li>
            <li>This project should document currently active or historical sites of pollution along the river, including its tributaries (East Williamsburg, Linden Hill, south of Sunnyside). It hopes to get in touch with local groups, such as the Newtown Creek Alliance, to understand their work and efforts. </li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>NYCHA Crisis, Gowanus, Brooklyn (Gowanus Houses)</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>NYCHA, the authority overlooking the City’s public housing projects, is in crisis. Decades of defunding from multiple levels send housing projects, many of which were built around the same time, into critical disrepair. </li>
            <li>The crisis here is two-fold. There is the tangible and visible state of dilapidation plaguing these housing projects, leading to unacceptable living conditions, from prolonged water and gas outage to chronicle health hazards such as elevated lead levels. At the same time, there is the institutional crisis, where, due to the bureaucratic nature of NYCHA, public housing residents are unable to hold the city accountable when it comes to providing equitable housing for them.</li>
            <li>Gowanus Houses are selected for the project because the area is currently undergoing a rezoning process, in which NYCHA residents’ demands are currently left behind in the rezoning proposal. This ongoing process could become a source of information that reveals the institutional issues, such as the struggle between residents, the Housing Authority, and real estate interests behind the scene. </li>
            <li>This project should uncover and capture signs of the housing project’s infrastructural crisis. At the same time, it should get in touch with the Community Board and local alliances to further understand the rezoning process, how they are actively asserting public housing residents’ demands, and how it would impact the future of the housing project; these insights should be documented in audios or videos.</li>
        </ul>
