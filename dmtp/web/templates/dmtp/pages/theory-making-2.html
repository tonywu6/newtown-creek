<p>“North Brooklyn Industrial Business Zone” — such is the name much of the neighborhoods of Greenpoint, Maspeth,
    and East Williamsburg has been designated in a <a
        href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/plans/north-brooklyn-vision-plan/north-brooklyn-vision-plan.page">2018
        New York City city planning report.</a> Together with the Maspeth IBZ and the Long Island City IBZ, they form a
    large industrial core in the City’s geographic heart, between Queens and Brooklyn. Flowing through these zones is
    Newtown Creek.</p>
<p>Much of the area’s heavy industries have moved out since the 1960s, due to a mix of factors such as shifting labor
    cost and relocation of production chains. Today, energy companies (ExxonMobil, National Grid) remain on
    large plots of land within Greenpoint and Maspeth, while areas near the upstream of Newtown Creek is dominated by
    wholesale businesses, food manufacturing industries (photos above), as well as warehouses.</p>

<p><a href="http://nysdecgreenpoint.com/ProjectHistory.aspx">On September 2, 1978,</a> during a routine patrol, a U.S.
    Coast Guard helicopter spotted swaths of black water on Newtown Creek’s surface near Greenpoint. One of America’s
    largest oil spills known today as the Greenpoint Oil Spill, it began back in 1950. By the time it was discovered, an
    estimated 17 gallons (64.3 liters) of petroleum have spilled under more than 52 acres (0.21 square kilometers) of
    land in Greenpoint.</p>
<hr />
<p>Talking of the Greenpoint Oil Spill as a single, isolated event, with discrete doers such as the oil companies, masks
    the complex systems and processes behind the spill. Crude oil, metal tanks, soil, residents, water, oil companies,
    fish, legislations, and many more “actants,” affect each other in chaotic ways. Together, they represent an <a
        href="https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/nyulibrary-ebooks/detail.action?docID=1170671">“assemblage” of
        things.</a></p>

</object>

<p>In the oil spill, petroleum and related liquids (oils, naphtha, kerosene, gasoline, etc), together called a “free
    product plume,” rest on top of the river bed and have affected the soil and groundwater. Newtown Creek’s riverbed is
    covered a pool of black, viscous pollutants, constantly releasing chemicals into the water above. The aquifer
    (permeable rock) under Greenpoint, which is contaminated with the majority of the spilled oil, continues to supply
    oil plume to the river through constant groundwater exchange.</p>
<p>Pollutants, now freely-floating/dissolved in the river, enter living things easily. They get absorbed by algae, which
    are
    primarily consumed by small fish and shellfish. Chemicals then travel up the food chain, as smaller organisms get
    consumed by large ones. Through bioaccumulation, toxins get more concentrated as they are taken
    in by animals of higher orders, such as birds and mammals.</p>

<p>The oil spill is not the only source of pollution in Newtown Creek. Since the beginning of heavy industries along the
    river, it has been used as drainage for all the toxic wastes. During heavy rainfall, rainwater overwhelms the City’s
    sewage system. As a result, sewage, both residential and industrial, backs and eventually spills into natural
    waters, bringing ground level wastes (trash, and, well, solid toxins) with it. This is called a Combined Sewage
    Overflow event — another form of assemblage, spontaneously formed and dissolved. Newtown Creek is a major outfall
    for such events.</p>

<hr />

<p>In these assemblages, humans are merely one of the myriad actors.</p>
<p>In an urban environment, at the end of the food chain is usually human. New Yorkers, if they were unaware of the
    pollution, harvest food from the river and consume it and get sick too. </p>

<p>During floods and storm surges (e.g. hurricanes), sewage will eventually flood back into the street, onto the curbs,
    into restaurants, bodegas, salons, supermarkets, houses …</p>

<p><em>Assemblages of consumption</em></p>

<p>Environmental topics such as oil spills and sewage overflow reveal our very <em>convenient</em> relationship with the
    environment.</p>
<p>Humanity&#39;s progress in industrialization and modernization (also, capitalism) has been compelled by a sense of
    resource scarcity. We are all hungry for materials. Materials are scarce. If I don’t grab the chip, someone might
    get it.</p>
<p>Yet conveniently, humanity&#39;s progress in industrialization and modernization has also been supported by a (false)
    sense that the environment is an endless pit for all the waste that is excreted.</p>
<p>Each company, each factory (along the river), takes care of its own flow of resources. Consumers (“customers”) also
    take care of their own. Each of these material flows is an assemblage of things, and each assemblage is most
    conscious of their own. </p>
<p>But ultimately, the environment itself is an assemblage — an assemblage of smaller systems (smaller assemblages) —
    and businesses and consumers are closely tied to the environment, in ways they are unaware of or choose to ignore.
</p>
<p>Assemblages, as they share common actants, do and will affect each other. System-wide (environment-wide) changes
    affect all systems, through mechanisms and power that are constantly in flux throughout the environment. Yet the
    small, hungry assemblages pay no attention.</p>
<p>That assemblages is in a constant dynamic and affect one another, dictates that the environment will feedback to
    human’s ignorance of the environment as a system they are inseparable from. At a certain point, the environment’s
    “hidden” potential emerges from within and turns outward. Petroleum emerges to the water surface. Sewage overflows
    into the river. People get sick from consuming toxins.</p>

<p>Industries, businesses, and consumers are hungry. City planning is hungry too. As New York City outlines its plan to
    bring “industry” and “innovations” back to North Brooklyn, “preexisting environmental conditions” get attention the
    last. Writing about the challenges industrial businesses are facing, in the City’s report, it says,</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Bulkheads along Newtown Creek are deteriorating, but many businesses cannot afford the expense of repairs; the
        Creek’s Superfund status also makes approvals for repairs more complex and onerous.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The environment is a nuisance. It is the appendix. But “complex and onerous” are culturally constructed signs — they
    are feelings, which the environment and its affect pay no attention to. It will be “complex and onerous” until
    unexpected, chaotic situations emerge in the environment. Then it becomes painful and costly.</p>
