                <li>The tyranny of measurement. </li>
                <li>Having a slightly higher temperature (37.0ºC/98.6ºF) means having to spend another 10 minutes taking another one. Having a fever means not only a possibility of infection, but also the further upending of everyday life: transported to the hospital, getting tested, etc. </li>
                <li>Thus the temperature is both an abstraction of the corporeal (body → data), and the very realization of it. It is also a source of anxiety.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>After taking the temperature, film the thermometer while I am holding it, make the reading visible, as if I am reading the temperature. </li>
                <li>The background should have sufficient contrast with the temperature (which is white). </li>

                <li>The constant anxiety of possibility of infection finds a (false) outlet through excessive absorption of information from the internet.</li>
                <li>Because of this anxiety and that I don’t have a fever, I constantly worry that I am an asymptomatic carrier of COVID-19. The fact that I did not get tested while entering Shanghai (despite what the city claimed) further aggravates this anxiety by increasing the uncertainty.</li>
                <li>As such, I find myself Googling more than one times the symptoms of COVID-19, as well as information about asymptomatic carriers.</li>

                <li>Should only include the upper left corner of the screen (where the UI is) so as to make sure text is legible. </li>

                <li>While in isolation, the peephole on the door becomes a source of intrigue. It is where I get to see <em>other people</em> up close — even if they (healthcare workers) are all fully cladded in PPEs. It is where I get to see meals being placed, packages being delivered, and the hallway being cleaned. Signs of life.</li>

                <li>It is also repeated three times a day, and therefore monotonous.</li>

                <li>This is yet another source of anxiety, both for me and for my family. It has an additional layer of my frustration with the bureaucracy and the general unresponsiveness of the city’s many departments.</li>
