<p><strong>Subject of Presentation</strong> Coronavirus Video Project</p>

<p><em>Navigating the Pandemic</em></p>

<p><strong>Concept</strong></p>

<p>As the title suggests, this video project documents my experience as I “navigate” i.e. move through the on-going COVID-19 pandemic. From NYU announcing dorm closure in the afternoon on March 16th, 2020, to my scrambling to find storage and flights back home, to my compulsory quarantine in Shanghai, China, the period between March 16 and April 6 had been one of my most surreal experiences in life. In this video, therefore, I strive to capture what I saw and heard, not only to produce a piece of evidence for the future, but also to think through, and perhaps analyze a bit, how media is shaping such a surreal experience.</p>

<p>This video presents the following observations of my journey back home.</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>See vs. hear</em> In my video project proposal, I imagine that my own visual and audio experience of the isolation becomes the subject of the video, and the camera will now have to recreate what I have seen and heard during my time in isolation as accurately as possible. As I recall how a day in my quarantine had been like, and as I go through the materials I’ve gathered, what I noticed starkly, are 1) there are two focal points of my visual attention: the peephole (the world outside), and news reports on my devices (the world further outside), and 2) in comparison to the deluge of visual stimuli especially from the screen, there are significantly less audio experience: most of my quarantine is quiet except for my own noises.</li>
	<li><em>Information overload</em> The video places a very heavy focus on presenting headlines. In my experiences, a considerable amount of time is effectively spent hopping from one breaking news to another. And so I wish to present this with montage consists solely of analog (as in physical) recordings of text on the screen.</li>
	<li><em>Documenting frustration</em> Additionally, in the video, I document one very specific event during my quarantine, which is my repeated inquiry to receive a test and my ultimate failure to receive one. Again, because the primary for of communication is through digital tools, the visual presentation of this is through screen recording.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Design</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li><em>Progression through diegetic elements</em> In this project, instead of using narrations or captions to progress the video, I instead present diegetic elements that would hint at such progression. For example, the fact that I am departing from the dorm and the city is suggested through the email from NYU, and that I am in quarantine is hinted through the IM messaging history between me and the quarantine facility personnels.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><em>Split screen</em> In some sections of the video, I present two videos at a time, side by side. This is a direct visualization of the parallel between the analog and the digital. I got the inspiration from Professor Bianco’s videos.</li>
</ul>
