<span><em>For the uninitiated readers from the future:</em> the original project of this website, which was the
    ecological study of Newtown Creek, was interrupted in March 2020 CE due to a global pandemic named
    <strong>"COVID-19"</strong> â€” by April, over a million people in the United States were infected, and thousands of
    people died everyday. As normal life was thoroughly disrupted, I began documenting the precarity of COVID-19
    instead.
    <br>
    This video project is a documentation of my experience as I travel from the US back to my hometown in China.
