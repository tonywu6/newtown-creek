                <li>The tyranny of measurement. </li>
                <li>Having a slightly higher temperature (37.0ºC/98.6ºF) means having to spend another 10 minutes taking another one. Having a fever means not only a possibility of infection, but also the further upending of everyday life: transported to the hospital, getting tested, etc. </li>
                <li>Thus the temperature is both an abstraction of the corporeal (body → data), and the very realization of it. It is also a source of anxiety.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>After taking the temperature, film the thermometer while I am holding it, make the reading visible, as if I am reading the temperature. </li>
                <li>The background should have sufficient contrast with the temperature (which is white). </li>

                <li>Only the upper 3/4 of the screen should be in the camera’s FOV. Doing so centers the actual UI.</li>
                <li>Can use camera on iPad or my camera. There should be sufficient lighting (e.g. daylight)</li>

                <li>Pacing back and forth is something I find myself doing a lot more while in isolation.</li>
                <li>It represents the restriction of mobility, the enclosing of space. It also suggests monotony , boredom, (and perhaps a bit of irritation).</li>

            <ul>
                <li>The constant anxiety of possibility of infection finds a (false) outlet through excessive absorption of information from the internet.</li>
                <li>Because of this anxiety and that I don’t have a fever, I constantly worry that I am an asymptomatic carrier of COVID-19. The fact that I did not get tested while entering Shanghai (despite what the city claimed) further aggravates this anxiety by increasing the uncertainty.</li>
                <li>As such, I find myself Googling more than one times the symptoms of COVID-19, as well as information about asymptomatic carriers.</li>

                <li>Should only include the upper left corner of the screen (where the UI is) so as to make sure text is legible. </li>
                <li>Camera axis should be perpendicular to the screen plane.</li>

                <li>While in isolation, the peephole on the door becomes a source of intrigue. It is where I get to see <em>other people</em> up close — even if they (healthcare workers) are all fully cladded in PPEs. It is where I get to see meals being placed, packages being delivered, and the hallway being cleaned. Signs of life.</li>
                <li>Perhaps, it is also a form of surveillance — one that I have control over.</li>

                <li>It is also repeated three times a day, and therefore monotonous.</li>

                <li>Despite that Shanghai promised to test everyone entering the city, I did not get testing landing in PVG while the airport got entirely overwhelmed by people returning from overseas — after I spent a good day and a half flying, in enclosed containers and close-proximity to a lot of people.</li>
                <li>This is yet another source of anxiety, both for me and for my family. It has an additional layer of my frustration with the bureaucracy and the general unresponsiveness of the city’s many departments.</li>

                <li>Alternatively, this can be made in the style of how news programs normally depict phone interviews: place the camera on the table and filming no particular subject.</li>
