<p><strong>Systemic Ambiguity</strong></p>

<p>Amy</p>

<p>"In a world in which a primary economic horizon is one of war in its various modalities (conflict with the irreducible other, the perpetual struggle of all against all, or asymmetric warfare), the kind of practical criticism traditionally carried out by intelligence and counterintelligence operatives becomes a vital necessity. As has recently been noted, the surprise conjunction of literary criticism and geopolitical strategizing represented by Cold War intelligence practices at senior levels of the CIA and its forerunners allowed for an attentiveness to, and cultivation of, ambiguity that presented an invaluable means for monitoring, evaluating, manipulating, and deceiving the other.  Ambiguity, along with the mental conflict it discloses and creates, is at once a diagnostic tool, to the extent that it symptomatizes potentially antagonistic or threatening intentions, and a critical weapon, to the extent that it creates doubts, uncertainties, and the possibilities for divergences in the field of action in which it is at work. For the assiduous operative holed up in an office in Langley, Virginia, in Ludovisi in Rome, or in St. James ’ s in London, applying the same scrupulous attention to textual detail and the nuances of phrase in a covert operation such as HT/Lingual as would once have been applied to a poem by Ezra Pound or a letter composed to e.   e. cummings appears as a geopolitical imperative and defense of imperiled imperial values." In this section, the authors discuss systemic ambiguity as a tool used during the Cold War, which the CIA then was left to decode. Today, we can see ambiguity being used as a tool by political figureheads such as our very own president. He tweets out various vague bits of information that seem to support his presidency, skirting around facts and therefore leaving us, the viewers, to decode his nonsensical words.</p>

<p><strong>Social Engineering</strong></p>

<p>Penelope</p>

<p>Social engineering is a psychological manipulation that targets people’s natural tendency of thinking. With artificial intelligence, operationalism can get close enough to real life thinking routine. There are some websites online now says that “artificial intelligence can predict what you look like when you get older”, or “when will your significant other half may appear”, etc. These are RNN responses generated from you personal information, with some transformation that mimics what might be your own expectation. Computing help to generate these data quickly, while targeting and changing people’s psychological tendency of how people tend to think. It may have a significant impact while people don’t even notice.  In this sense, social engineering—as the means of blagging your way through a rule set and its lackeys and their equipment—is always one of the crucial components of accounts of army, prison, or camp life, the means for a bit of unfettering, a little back channel. In such cases, social engineering is the essential lubricant of a disciplinary society or a total institution, although calling it engineering is a little grandiose; others may call it a work-around or persuasion. How, though, does its position shift in a context whose governance is actuated by scripts? Whether read by people at the other end of a phone line or run as software, the script is crucial in getting everyone and everything to play a role, and in the way that is required. As Herbert Simon notes, “Administration is not unlike play-acting. . . . The effectiveness of the administrative process will vary with the effectiveness of the organization and the effectiveness with which its members play their parts.”</p>

<p><strong>Abstract Captures</strong></p>

<p>Tony</p>

<p>What is abstraction? “[T]he theory of abstract-state machines is … a ‘wide spectrum method’ to “bridge the gap between the two ends of system development: the human understanding and formulation of real-world problems; [and] the deployment of their algorithmic solutions by code-executing machines on changing platforms” (Fuller and Goffey 2012). Abstraction is a practice/technique in programming/algorithm design, in which a complex problem is broken down (abstracted) into smaller, simpler problems; but it is also pervasive in our everyday life: almost all problem solving requires some form of abstraction. It is a way of imagination — imagining people as “end users,” companies as “legal persons,” a complex interpersonal network on Facebook as a set of dots and lines (a graph), sorting a list of 10000 items as sorting 5,000 lists of 2 items, and for the sake of fighting COVID-19, we are now picking up selected info about people such as their travel history so as to quickly identify high-risk areas in cities. The tool of abstraction is immensely powerful, as it simplifies problems greatly. Yet we must also be careful when applying it: when our abstraction distorts and departs from the complex reality, things will go wrong.</p>
