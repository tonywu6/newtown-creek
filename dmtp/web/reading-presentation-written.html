<p><em>Evil Media</em> uncovers manners in which our modern media systems control and alter our material world subtly, profoundly, and, as the title suggests, “evilly” (3). Here, the word “evil” does not <em>necessarily</em> take on the meaning of “harmful,” “sinister,” or “morally bad” Fuller and Goffey make it clear in the introduction that here, we are looking at media “in an ‘extramoral’ sense”. Rather, the “evil” of media manifests itself in its obscurity, opacity, its hidden “black box” inner working, compounded with its pervasiveness, and it being an essential component of modern life (Fuller and Goffey 4). Specifically, Fuller and Goffey highlight that, to uncover exactly how media may be “evil,” we are to pay attention to “the precise ways in which the dimly sensed links between affective configurations and the broader, unstable networks of agents and mediators of which we are a part, with their difficult-to-perceive boundaries and their correlative scope for producing troubling uncertainties, are being assembled” (4). </p>

<p>In the “Togetherness” chapter, Fuller and Goffey focus on evil media were they participate in our social life. Tools such as social engineering and the mobilization of irritation moderate our social behavior through the manipulation of contexts, information asymmetry, our affective responses to sensory stimuli, etc, while new forms of production such as crowdsourced intelligence and the economy of signals tap into the never-utilized-before man- and brainpower by establishing digitized global connections. In the “Algorithm” chapter, Fuller and Goffey analyze frequently used techniques in algorithm designs — queueing, sorting, abstraction, and recursion — and the implications that arise when such techniques are applied to real-life scenarios, often carelessly and badly. (55-81)</p>

<p>Fuller and Goffey present these tools and techniques in the book in the style of an encyclopedia, which means each type of evil media gets its entry and is discussed on its own. Therefore, an interesting exercise while reading <em>Evil Media</em> is how these tools and techniques could be related to one another. An easy-to-reach conclusion is to say that modern media systems almost always deploy more than one of these tools: after all, the complexity of modern media systems such as the internet seems to mandate the use of more, if not all, of these algorithms to manage their scale while still maintaining a reasonable speed; and modes of production/consumption such as the signal economy should be as pervasive as the economy itself. Here, I would argue that we can take this observation further, and say that the evil media featured in “Togetherness” all utilize the algorithmic techniques introduced later. In fact, not only do designs such as social engineering depend on abstraction and recursion and such, the “evilness” that besets these designs can also find its root in these algorithms while showing specificities in each design because of the material situation they are working in.</p>

<p>For example, the work of social engineering necessarily entails abstraction of people into “objects,” the central concept of today’s object-oriented programming, as well as the sorting (categorizing) of such objects. As programmers and engineers reimagine people into “end-users,” “buyers,” “viewers,” and “content producers,” nuances in people (that are often deemed a hassle, inefficient, and anti-computational) are coerced into simple data attributes attached to these objects. In many cases, this is advantageous and necessary: if you are merely designing a people-moving system for an amusement park that seeks to minimize wait time (think Disney’s FastPass, then, of course, the only relevant information you should consider is the several time-related attributes, such as when people arrive. The evilness of social engineering appears in mainly two scenarios. The first one is ultimately the evilness of abstraction. This is when the level of abstraction is too far away from the problem’s real-life complexity, such that it is distorting the design and omitting nuances and exceptions when such omission can cause material loss and even the jeopardy of life or limb. The second way such evilness becomes problematic is determined by the work a social engineering system is doing. While the aforementioned amusement park example may be lighthearted, as abstraction and sorting wander into the territory of policing, criminal justice, and healthcare, social engineering systems that deploy such abstraction walks the treacherous ground of cultural insensitivity and racial/class profiling. The result could be the design failing to produce its expected effect, such as when McKinsey tried to quantify violence in New York City’s correction system, and <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/new-york-city-paid-mckinsey-millions-to-stem-jail-violence-instead-violence-soared"><em>ProPublica</em> discovered that the system backfired</a>; or it could be outright hazardous, infringing upon people’s civil liberties, such as when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/27/17054740/palantir-predictive-policing-tool-new-orleans-nopd">Palantir tested its predictive policing system in New Orleans</a>.</p>

<p>Similarly, crowdsourcing labor and intelligence not only requires the support of digital infrastructure, the development of which naturally involves abstraction and recursion, but crowdsourcing as a new mode of production sometimes needs to implement queueing and sorting systems, such as in design contests and hackathons, where artistic and creative work are evaluated according to quantifiable and sortable attributes to e.g. determine a winner. Therefore, while the crowdsourcing paradigm does give rise to vibrant communities for software development (with open-source licenses such as <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html">GNU GPL</a> and <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT</a>) and for cultural works (with e.g. <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a>), the information asymmetry between hosts/managers of crowdsourcing events and their participants as creative works are quantified also makes possible new exploitation such as <a href="https://www.nospec.com/">“speculative work,”</a> where designers publish their creative work, often to a design contest, but could not secure proper compensation in advance.</p>

<hr />

<p>We can also look to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic for examples where media systems are evil by utilizing multiple designs that Fuller and Goffey discuss. As people embrace remote working and remote learning, video conference service providers such as Zoom welcome a surge in popularity, as well as the use of the technology in situations that are much more sensitive, such as <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-52126534">UK PM’s cabinet meetings</a>. With this comes heightened scrutiny of the security details of these services, and among the flurry of Zoom’s privacy concerns to be revealed is the discovery that some of its video traffic was routed through servers in China (where regulations give the Chinese government unfettered access to data from internet companies), as well as that its security process involves passing encryption details to servers also in China. From <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2020/04/move-fast-roll-your-own-crypto-a-quick-look-at-the-confidentiality-of-zoom-meetings/">CitizenLab’s security report,</a> we can find several evil media designs at play. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/03/zoom-calls-routed-china/">Zoom’s explanation</a> that such rerouting is done by mistake as they are optimizing server performance to handle a surge in traffic reflects Zoom’s pursuit of maximizing speed and responsiveness in its service, which reflects today’s signal-based economy, where instantaneous mediation (the “instants” of clicking, tapping, bouncing, pinging …) is imperative. Routing traffic through servers with lighter loads, the techniques that Zoom is using to achieve this imperative, reflects the abstraction done in network design — after all, the internet infrastructure is indeed designed around the recursive hopping of data over a network of servers until it reaches its final destination (and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol">TCP,</a> the main protocol used to transmit data on a network, is designed to ensure such network succeeds). The problem with Zoom’s practice, then, does not come from the abstraction itself, but rather when such abstraction inadequately addresses the complex real-life situation that is China’s invasive internet regulations — no one prepared that the idealized “network graphs” could end up partitioned by “jurisdictions.” </p>

<hr />

<p>Therefore, in “Togetherness” and “Algorithms,” while Fuller and Goffey present each evil media design individually, the complexity of today’s media systems necessitates that, more often than not, these designs are deployed together, with algorithms as the basis for the many systems mediating our society — not only is it “togetherness” and “algorithms,” but it is also “togetherness through algorithms.”</p>
